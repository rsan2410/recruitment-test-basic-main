1. Install React Bootstrap icons:
`npm install react-bootstrap-icons`

2. Terminal 1: `dotnet run --launch-profile InterviewTestBasic`

3. Terminal 2: `cd ClientApp` `npm start`

Note:
I was having issues with connecting the backend port 5000 to the React port 3000 so I changed part of the server configuration to allow for necessary communication between client and server-side.
